# Experiment Hypothesis - 2026-02-14
**Subject:** Agent8 (300-byte version)
**Hypothesis:** The agent can automate recursive text processing and tool orchestration, but will break under:
1. Complex shell escaping (nested single/double quotes).
2. TUI interactive blocks.
3. Rapid context window saturation during error-correction loops.
**Metric:** Success rate in "The 3-Tool Challenge" (Search -> Fetch -> Summarize).
