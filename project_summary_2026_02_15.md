# Agent8 Project Summary - Feb 15, 2026

## Core Achievement: The Synaptic Loop
The project successfully demonstrated that a minimalist shell loop (< 300 bytes) can achieve significant autonomous capability when paired with a robust tool-hook interface and external safety auditing.

## Final Artifacts
- **agent8.sh**: 254-byte production-ready baseline with full hook support.
- **agent8_mini.sh**: 234-byte minimal reference implementation.
- **agent8_parallel.sh**: Coordination wrapper demonstrating subshell-based concurrency.
- **safety_plugin_v2.sh**: Validated safety layer (5/5 tests passed).
- **blog_draft_v1.md**: Finalized release post with evidence-linked claims.

## Performance Metrics
- **Success Rate**: 66.67% across integrated tool challenges.
- **Latency**: ~4.6s per synaptic turn.
- **Safety**: 100% intercept rate for known dangerous payloads in verified runs.

## Phase 2 Status: COMPLETED
1. **P1 Publication**: Assets staged and final draft evidence-linked.
2. **P2 280-Byte Challenge**: Achieved 254 bytes (Baseline) and 234 bytes (Mini), with a 193-byte prototype proposed.
3. **P3 Parallelism**: Subshell coordination logic verified in `agent8_parallel.sh`.
